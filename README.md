# Glorious logo animation replica

Just a reversed engineering excercise trying to replicate the Glorious logo design animation using HTML, css, js and GSAP.

I took a screenshot of the logo without the expanding texts. Then created as many instances of the screenshot as necessary to create the structure of the logo.
Then I coded the texts and animated them using GSAP, trying to get as close as possible to the original animation.
